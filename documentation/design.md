1. Atoms (Smallest Building Blocks)

    These are the most basic UI elements that cannot be broken down further.
    Examples: Buttons, Inputs, Labels, Icons, Colors, Typography.

2. Molecules (Combination of Atoms)

    These are small, reusable components made of multiple atoms working together.
    Examples: Search Bar (Input + Button), Form Field (Label + Input), Card (Image + Title + Text).

3. Organisms (More Complex Components)

    These are groups of molecules and atoms working together to form a distinct section of a UI.
    Examples: Navigation Bar (Logo + Menu Items + Search Bar), Product Card (Image + Description + Price + Button).

4. Templates (Page Layouts)

    These define the overall structure without real content.
    Examples: Dashboard Layout, Blog Post Layout.

5. Pages (Final UI with Real Data)

    These are fully built pages where templates are filled with real content.
    Examples: Homepage, Product Page, Checkout Page.
